= Running =

PyInYourFace requires:
 * [http://www.python.org/ Python 2.6+]
 * [http://numpy.scipy.org/ NumPy]
 * [http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML PyYAML]
 * [http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ OpenCV 2.x]

Once the necessary prerequisites are installed and on your PYTHONPATH, you should be able to run 'align' or 'train' successfully with your Python interpreter.

I've only tested this code on 64-bit Linux systems, but there's no reason why it shouldn't work on other platforms. If you run into problems, leave a comment or send me an email.
